Hi, these are 20 lines of python that can beat any human at https://isthisprime.com/game/.

In future I'll write is_prime() function in C.
Turns out the game gets harder and performance actually matters. 
I heard AKS is the fastest precise primality test.
However in this game probabilistic tests might achive higher score.

If you are new to web automation please google how to install selenium &
chromedriver on your system. Make sure DRIVER_PATH in your code is right. 

Have fun!
